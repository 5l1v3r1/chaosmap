////[ Whats this all about?

Chaosmap is just another network mapping tool.
It can be used to lookup DNS names with a dictionary with or without using a salt. 
Salting for DNS means it will append numbers from 1-9 to the name in the dictionary with or without 
a - and _ or a leading 0. Salting for Web stuff will try double slashes and some directory traversal tricks.
You can do reverse dns lookups of a whole ip range (with optional whois lookup) or
make a dictionary scan for hidden paths on one webserver or a range of ip addresses.
Optionally you can encode the path with url encoding.
Feel free to send patches, bug reports, dictionaries or beer to balle@chaostal.de


////[ Installation

You need Python 2.6 or higher.


///[ Example usage:

# dictionary based dns lookups with salt (appends 1 and -1 and so on)
./chaosmap.py -f dict -d your_domain -n -s

# scan your webserver for hidden paths with url encoding via a http proxy
./chaosmap.py -f dict -d your_domain -w -u -P 192.168.1.1:8080

# reverse dns and whois lookup of ip range
./chaosmap.py -i 192.168.1.1-192.168.254.254 -W -n

# dictionary scan of web server on port 8080 with salting
./chaosmap.py -f dict_file -d your_domain -w -p 8080 -s

# scan a list of ip addresses for web servers with hidden paths with a delay of 3 seconds
./chaosmap.py -i 192.168.1.1-192.168.254.254 -f dict_file -w -D 3
